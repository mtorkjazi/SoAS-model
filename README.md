A Systems Engineering Methodology for System of Autonomous Systems: Architecture and Integration
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) rapidly transform individual systems by providing autonomous capabilities. This new class of systems becomes a constituent system in a System of Systems (SoS), evolving it into a System of Autonomous Systems (SoAS). SoAS is fraught with new Systems Engineering (SE) challenges for architecting, integration, testing, and evaluation that originate from the Level of Autonomy (LoA) of autonomous systems. The LoA refers to the level of autonomous capabilities of a system depending on its AI/ML technology. This paper examines SoAS architecting and integration challenges such as identifying the suitable LoA in constituent systems of SoAS. In this paper, we propose an architecting and integration method that builds upon the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) and modify it to facilitate autonomy integration by leveraging the SWOT (i.e., Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) analysis and SoAS taxonomy. Moreover, the proposed method tailors the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) to model different levels of abstraction of SoAS with varying LoAs. The current study leads to generating necessary evaluation data for a trade study analysis and selecting an architecture with the most suitable LoAs. We also present a conceptual example of a search-and-rescue SoS to demonstrate the implementation and effectiveness of the proposed method in investigating the evolution of LoA in constituent systems.
